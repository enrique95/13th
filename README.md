# TFG

My thesis (TFG) consists of 2 branches: first the data extraction and analysis and second the creation of graphs using the ipumsr and ggplot2 extensions of R.

Each of them have a .R script. 

The first branch will contain also the .csv files for the agricultural and demographic data and the .RData environment

The second one contains only the script, as the spatial data and the environment is too big to host in github
