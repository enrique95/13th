# TFG

My thesis (TFG) consists of 2 branches: first the data extraction and analysis and second the creation of graphs using the ipumsr and ggplot2 extensions of R.

Each of them have a .RData file containing the R environment and a script. 

The first branch will contain the .csv files for the agricultural and demographic data

The second one contains the same files as well as spatial data in order to create geographical representations of the data
