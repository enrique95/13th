# 13th

This will be a fork of my bachelor thesis `TFG` repository but focused on the use of R.

Instead of adding content to the `LaTeX` template the report will be made in `Rmarkdown`.  (change r script to rmd script in the future)

The data will be improved, trying to add more and more years to the data, and in the future the shape files will be added through git LFS. 
Thus the repo will depend on its own hosted files instead of sending the user to a webpage to download them by itself and source them locally.

The .sh file is only for Arch Linux use. In the future I'll include other linux flavors. Probably this shell script will come with no execute permissions. If this is the case run `chmod 777 /path/to/the/file.sh` in your terminal.
