# TFG

My thesis (TFG) consists of 2 parts: first the data extraction and analysis and second the creation of graphs using the ipumsr and ggplot2 extensions of R.

Each of them have a reproducible R script

The first part contains the .csv files for the agricultural and demographic data
The second one contains the same files as well as spatial data in order to create geographical representations of the data

The main branch contains the environment for the first part. The environment for the second part is not possible to upload because it's too large to host in github
The main branch also contains the .tex files for the thesis and the beamer presentationn
